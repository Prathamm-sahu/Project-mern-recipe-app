Learn about HTTP response status codes

Find a way to move directly from http:localhost:3000/save-recipe to http:localhost:3000/auth not to http:localhost:3000/save-recipe/auth


good practice is to check if cookie token is same for a particular user, instead of just checking if the cookie token is present or not


why option field in setCookie is not working

If we add httpOnly field in the setCookie function then it does not set the cookie and after removing httpOnly field rest other field are working properly


I think this must be the same issue with res.cookie() function in node.js in Travery media authentication project 

Task is to check the above issue in authentication project
